# CIS174_Unit6
Master and content page demonstration
My original issue was the class I created in the App_Content folder is not recognised in the Reservation.cs file I am call it in even after I changed the Build Action property of the class file to compile versus the default content.
I solved the issue by declaring the namespace of the class in question in my in-working .cs file.
